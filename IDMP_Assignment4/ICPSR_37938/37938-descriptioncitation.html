		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The TransPop study is the first national probability sample of transgender individuals in the United States (it also includes a comparative cisgender sample). A primary goal of this study was to provide researchers with a representative sample of transgender people in the United States. The study examines a variety of health-relevant domains including health outcomes and health behaviors, experiences with interpersonal and institutional discrimination, identity, transition-related experiences, and basic demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, religion, political party affiliation, marital status, employment, income, location, sex, gender, and education).</p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> <p>This study is the first national probability sample of transgender individuals in the U.S. and thus will be provide a more accurate and detailed picture of the issues faced by transgender people. To date, what researchers know about the transgender population comes from studies that do not use random selection methods. While those studies provided valuable information about transgender lives, they may not  accurately represent the population. With a probability sample, this study provides researchers and policy makers with unbiased estimates about demographics, health outcomes and well-being, and health care needs of the transgender population, which will be crucial for designing evidence-based public health and policy interventions.</p>
<p><b>TransPop Study aims to...</b></p>
<p><ul><li>Describe demographic parameters of the U.S. transgender population, such as race/ethnicity, age, gender identity, education, employment, etc.</li>
<li>Describe basic health outcomes and health behaviors, such as health status, health care access, quality of life, etc.</li>
<li>Describe experiences of transgender people with interpersonal and institutional discrimination in areas such as healthcare, employment, housing, etc.</li>
<li>Describe transgender identity history and transition-related experiences.</li></ul></p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> Two data sources contribute to the TransPop study. The first source is the TransPop survey, which was administered to transgender people, including gender nonbinary people who identify as transgender (but not gender nonbinary individuals who did not identify as transgender). The second data source includes a national probability sample of cisgender respondents, collected for comparison to the TransPop sample. The transgender and cisgender data sources were combined to create one dataset that includes both samples. This dataset is described in more detail on page 5 of the User Guide.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <p><b>TransPop Sample</b>:</p>
<p><b>Period 1:</b></p>
<p>The Period 1 sample was recruited between April 2016 and August 2016. In total, 149,593 participants were screened by Gallup for inclusion in the study, of which 185 (0.12%) were classified as transgender and eligible to participate in the study. Of those
eligible, 136 (73.5%) agreed to participate in the survey and of those, 56 (41.2%)
completed the survey, for a total response rate of 30.3% (among those initially eligible).</p>
<p><b>Period 2:</b></p>
<p>The Period 2 sample was recruited between June 2017 and December 2018. In total, 432,251 participants were screened by Gallup for inclusion in the study, of which 929 (0.21%) were classified as transgender and eligible to participate in the study. Of those eligible, 668 (71.9%) agreed to participate in the survey and of those, 270 (40.4%) completed the survey, for a total response rate of 28.7% (among those initially eligible).
The final TransPop sample size is 274.</p>
<p><b>Cisgender Sample:</b></p>
<p>The cisgender sample was recruited between February 19-23, 2018 and November 12-
December 10, 2018. In total, 4,020 participants were screened by Gallup for inclusion in
the study. In total, 87.6% (N = 3,523) were eligible to participate based on the final
eligibility criteria. Of those eligible, 2,548 (72.3%) agreed to participate in the survey and
of those, 1,184 (46.7%) completed the survey, for a total response rate of 33.6% (among
those initially eligible). Of these, 22 respondents were dropped due to missing data
leaving a final sample size of 1,162.</p>

								<p><span><strong>Presence of Common Scales:</strong> <p>Several items from the TransPop study are part of validated scales, designed to measure constructs relevant to identity, stress, and health. Each of the scales within the TransPop survey have been calculated from individual variables, according to published instructions, detailed below. Two calculated variables are included in the dataset for each of the scales: an un-imputed version and an imputed version. The unimputed version has missing values for participants who were missing on one or more items that make up the scale. The imputed variable has no missing values. The steps taken to create each scale are described on page 26 of the Survey Methods document.</p>
<p>These scales include:
<ul><li>Social Well-being</li>
<li>Satisfaction with life</li>
<li>Multi-group ethnic identity</li>
<li>Community connectedness</li>
<li>Non-affirmation of gender identity (transgender sample only)</li>
<li>Healthcare stereotype threat (Transgender sample only)</li>
<li>Psychological Distress, Kessler-6</li>
<li>Alcohol Use (AUDIT-C)</li>
<li>Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT)</li>
<li>Internalized transphobia (Transgender sample only)</li>
<li>Everyday discrimination</li>
<li>Chronic strains</li>
<li>Childhood gender nonconformity</li>
<li>Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE)</li>
<li>Gender identity non-disclosure (Transgender sample only)</li>
<li>Negative expectations of the future (Transgender sample only)</li>
<li>Social support</li></ul></p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Version History:</strong> <p>2021-06-23 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Performed consistency checks.</li><li>Created online analysis version with question text.</li><li>Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
		        		<h2>Analysis Information:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Weight:</strong> Both the TransPop and Cisgender datasets have the same variable named WEIGHT as the weighting variable. The combination datasets have a set of three weight variables (WEIGHT_TRANSPOP, WEIGHT_CISGENDER, WEIGHT_CISGENDER_TRANSPOP). The results will be representative of the sample when the weight is applied. Pages 41 and 42 of the user guide contain instructions that detail how to apply the final sample weight using Stata or SPSS.</span></p>
